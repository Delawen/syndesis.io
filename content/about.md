Syndesis is a flexible platform that provides core integration capabilities as a service. It can be run on the cloud or on premises with [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). It is fully extensible and, best of all, it is free and open source software.

## Open source IPAAS

[Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/information-platform-as-a-service-ipaas) defines an **Integration Platform As A Service** as is a suite of cloud services enabling development, execution and governance of integration flows connecting any combination of on premises and cloud-based processes, services, applications and data within individual or across multiple organizations.

We add the **Open Source** on top of it!

## Citizen integrator

Our target user is known as **citizen integrator**. You can find many definitions around it, but we want to make it simple. A citizen integrator is any user that needs to perform a quick integration between sources of data without writing any line of code. A few example to illustrate it:

* Read data from a database and create a report to an excel file on a cloud service
* Call a REST API and use the result to send Salesforce promotion
* Create a quick OpenAPI REST service and back to a database of your choice

## Quickstart demo

As a picture is worth a thousand words, and a video a thousands of pictures, you can enjoy this quickstart demo to see Syndesis in action:

## Open source technologies

We are proud to be an open source and community oriented software. Syndesis is an integration platform inspired by [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) project complemented by other open source projects such as [AtlasMap](https://www.atlasmap.io/) or [Apicurio](https://www.apicur.io/). The combination of these technologies provide a flexible **low code integration platform**. You can use the powerful visual tools in order to build your integration and be confident they will run on the chosen runtime.

You're invited to [contribute the community](/community/) using any of the channel you prefer.
