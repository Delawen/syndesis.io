      <description>Buildtool &amp;ldquo;syndesis&amp;rdquo; Syndesis uses a single tool for controlling various aspects of the build and developer related tasks. This script can be found in $SYNDESIS_DIR/tools/bin and is called syndesis. It requires bash and can be used on any Unix or macOS.
To have this script handy all the time it is recommended to either put this bin/ directory into the path or add a symlink from syndesis into a directory which is already on your execution path.</description>

      <description>One of the most important features of Syndesis is to be able to connect to a variety of sources and destinations. This middleware product will transparently take care of the integration of such data source/destination. It just requires a custom development of the specific transport involved in the chosen component.
Since Apache Camel is providing a large offering of integrations components, Syndesis does offer the possibility to use them thanks to a proxy component whose goal is to identify the component and provide the correct configuration settings to make them available through the user interface.</description>
