It has been a long hard way, but we have just released Syndesis 1.9.0!

This version includes many new features since latest 1.8.13 release. We have now new connectors for Kafka, Debezium, Amazon DDB and many others. It also contains several bug fixes, upgrades of dependencies and uses a newer Camel version (2.23). We encourage everyone to update their Syndesis installations to this new version. Let us know what are the new features you enjoy most!

This may be our last minor release until we move on to Syndesis 2.0, which will include the new Camel 3 framework among many other new features. Contributions are welcome to help stabilize current master branch and speed up our 2.0 release.
