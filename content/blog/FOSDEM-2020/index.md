FOSDEM is a two-day free, no registration, just show up, event in Brussels, Belgium, happening each year on the first weekend of February. It is the biggest community event around free/open source software and a great place to meet in person and exchange ideas.

This year FOSDEM is on the 1st and 2nd of February at the [Universit√© libre de Bruxelles Campus du Solbosch](https://fosdem.org/2020/practical/transportation/).

The Syndesis project will be represented at the [Integration Community Stand](https://fosdem.org/2020/stands/) which we share with the [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/blog/FOSDEM-2020/) community.

And [Maria](https://delawen.com/) will talk about [Integration Processes](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/integration_processes/) in the [Geospatial](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/geospatial/) devroom, so be sure to check that out as well.

[Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) has kindly sponsored us with stickers and T-shirts, so come by, grab some swag and talk to us about low-code software integration.
